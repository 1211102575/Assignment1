## Compilation Instructions

Provide instructions on how to compile your program, especially when it is non-trivial.

For example:

```
g++ character.cpp gameboard.cpp command.cpp main.cpp -o filename.exe
```

## User Manual

First ,run the programme on terminal,then it will show "Do you wish to change the game settings (y/n)? =>".If you want to change the settings of number of zombie, row/column(which can only be odd number) , type 'y' ,if u want to use default settings ,type 'n'.After that ,computer will show you the gameboard and the attribute of alien and zombies exist.

You are able to see a 'command> ' on your terminal, type whichever direction you want the Alien go eg: up,down,left and right, then Alien will go to the end of gameboard.

There is a "help" command if you are still not familiar with the control.

You can change the direction of the arrow by typing "arrow" and then the row and the column and then the direction.

Use the arrow to kill the zombies!!!

Each character on the map has its function.

Everytime the alien hits the border/rock/zombie. Alien's turn ends. And zombie starts to move.
Be careful of the super scary zombie which has 100 damage!!!!

You save and load whenever you want.
